# Butterfly Algorithm

This is my attempt to make the Butterfly Algorithm more palatable
by using pictures, text, math and code.

The notebook in progress can be [viewed][1] on `nbviewer`.

It started out of a Beamer slide deck I made for myself to understand it
better and will be re-arranged periodically to make the exposition
easier to digest.

See [MIT 18.336][2] for a great [diagram][3].
